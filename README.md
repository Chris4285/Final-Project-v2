# Final Project Keynotes

In my final project here, I have created two versions because I could not form two versions of my projects into one; Both solutions use the same math and both share similar comments,
however, both projects do two different things that were cumbersome to combine. [v1] (https://github.com/Chris4285/Final-Project-v1.git) follows the rule of thirds idea that I had
and showcases the grids and their position on the coordinates, while [v2] (https://github.com/Chris4285/Final-Project-v2.git) showcases uploading a custom image to see it resized in
that said aspect ratio.

#Usage

Both projects have been uploaded as repositories to Github with their builds and can be accessible by entering this in your Terminal on MacOS and Command Prompt on Windows with (Git Bash) [https://git-scm.com/downloads]
However due to the restrictions on cross-platform use of C#, the build can only be used on Windows, however workarounds can be used with Wine on MacOS

Version 1
```
git clone https://github.com/Chris4285/Final-Project-v1.git
```

Version 2
```
git clone https://github.com/Chris4285/Final-Project-v2.git
```

#Comments

The one issue that I will admit I ran into is on Version 1 at lines 53-72 in the Form1.cs file, it is shown that I run the same line 9 times for the picture boxes. I would've wanted
to be able to run in the method however that all squares would be changed and grouped together. I know there is a way as to how however I dont't know it.
